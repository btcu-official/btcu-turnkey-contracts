# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All tests passing (npm test)
- [ ] Clarinet check passes
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Security audit completed

## Testnet Deployment
- [ ] Deploy contracts: `clarinet deployments apply --testnet`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Initialize sBTC contract
  ```bash
  stx call-contract <deployer> btc-university set-sbtc-contract \
    -a ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token \
    --testnet
  ```
- [ ] Verify sBTC contract set: `get-sbtc-contract` returns correct address

- [ ] Test course enrollment with real sBTC
- [ ] Test fee claiming with real sBTC

## Mainnet Deployment

- [ ] Deploy contracts: `clarinet deployments apply --mainnet`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Initialize sBTC contract
  ```bash
  stx call-contract <deployer> btc-university set-sbtc-contract \
    -a SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token \
    --mainnet
  ```
- [ ] Verify sBTC contract set
- [ ] Small test transaction
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

## Security Verification
- [ ] sBTC contract is set (not none)
- [ ] sBTC contract points to official address
- [ ] Cannot pass fake sBTC contracts (test with wrong address → should fail)
